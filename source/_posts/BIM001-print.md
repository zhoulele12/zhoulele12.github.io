Everyone in my dorm is annoyed by the room locks. 

They are designed to be opened by either 1. tapping your phone AND entering a password, or 2. using a key.

Major hassle. Plus, this means you gotta bring your key to toilet, shower, basically whenever you leave the room. And not surprisingly, people forget their keys all the time.

So, I built a fingerprint lock using an Arduino, a servo, and a fingerprint sensor. Easy.

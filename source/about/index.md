Hi, my name is Chengyang Zhou (周成扬).

I'm from China and I'm currently studying Electrical&Computer Engineering and Computer Science at Duke University.

I like to build stuff: AI, robots, that sort of things. And on this website you can find detailed instructions on how to reproduce them.

In my free time, I play basketball and Digital Combat Simulator World, and I (very occasionally) post my highlights on Bilibili. [Here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1TV411e7i2/) is an example.

Besides, I'm a fan of Real Madrid FC. Hala Madrid!
